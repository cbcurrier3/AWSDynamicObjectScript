to update on a regular interval, just once and has options for using a local
file, a different url and can be disabled or the status retrieved.

the Gateway and run locally form each respective gateway.

     dyno_aws.sh -o AwsDynObj  -a on

Run Right away
     dyno_aws.sh -o AwsDynObj -a run

    dyno_aws.sh -o AwsDynObj -a off

Get Object status
       dyno_aws.sh -o AwsDynObj -a stat
